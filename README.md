# password-generator


## Description
This is a random password generator that creates a password after the user answers a series of prompts. 

The first prompt, in which the user defines the number of characters in the password, is the most relevant. The password matches that particular criteria. 

The user is also asked to click OK to confirm that the password will include lowercase and uppercase letters as well as numbers and special characters. The user has no choice but to click OK. For future practice, I'll give the user a bit more choice here.

For now, this will generate a password that meets the above criteria, including the one that is specified by the user (password length). The password will be displayed on the page.
